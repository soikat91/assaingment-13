Part 2: Laravel Folder Structure Describe:


1.App:This folder is the main directory for application's code and contains the models, controllers, and other supporting classes 
    that make up the core functionality of application.

2.Bootstrap: This folder contains files that are necessary to bootstrap,
    such as the app.php file, which sets up the Laravel application and loads the necessary configuration files.

 
3.Config: This folder contains configuration files for application,
    such as database settings, application settings, and service providers. 
    These files can be used to customize the behavior of Laravel or add additional functionality.

4.Database: This folder contains all of the database-related files for your application, including migrations, seeders, and factories. 
    These files allow you to easily create and modify your application's database schema.

5.Public: This folder contains all of the public-facing files of your application, such as the index.php file, 
    which is the entry point for all incoming requests. This folder also contains any assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files 
    that are publicly accessible.

6.Resources: This folder contains non-PHP resources, such as views, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
    These files are used to create the user interface of your application.

    These routes can be defined using a variety of HTTP verbs and can be used to map requests to specific controllers or functions.

8.Storage: This folder contains files that are generated by application, such as log files and cached views. 
    It also contains sub-folders for specific types of files such as app storage, logs, framework cache, and sessions.

9.Tests: This folder contains the automated tests for application. These tests are used to ensure that application is working 
    correctly and can be used to catch errors before they become problems.

10.Vendor: This folder contains the dependencies that application requires, such as the Laravel framework itself, 
    as well as any third-party packages that installed via Composer. 
    These dependencies are managed by Composer and are installed automatically when create a new Laravel project.
